# Inventory-Filtering
This program automates all of the filtering that was require on an inventory report from one of our suppliers. Ultimately, this program saved members of our eCommerce staff roughly 2hrs/week.

This project both cuts down on time required for manual data entry, by formatting data from an inventory report ito an import template for easy uploading, It also provided an opportunity for me to practice using OAuth2 and the google drive API.

Project Scope:
-- csvtojson CLI tool
-- filtering an array of objects
-- writting objects to a csvfile
-- saving csv file to a shared/team folder in google drive (using OAuth2 and Google Drive API) -- more practice with Gaxios
